                <p>Political analysts may once have depended entirely on subjective attributes, such as ethics, charisma, and non---scientific impressions of the electorate to forecast elections, but with the rise of data generated from human daily interaction with software systems, it is possible to add meaningful data---driven attributes to political forecasting alongside all of the demographic information available to today’s political consultant. Big Data collected using internet---of---things devices, online social networks, large---scale surveys, search engine queries, and others can be very useful for forecasting or guiding winning candidates. This applies to fomenting and forecasting political unrest as well as predicting democratic election outcome, as recent work on empirically determining tipping points in influencing public opinion has shown.</p>
                <p>Marketing companies and election consultants have long used sophisticated polling techniques in order to determine and shape public opinion so that candidates can use their findings to their advantage. In the last decade, however, we have seen well---known applications of large---scale data analysis in politics. For example, in 2008, President Obama’s campaign very effectively monitored and leveraged social media as an important part of his campaign strategy.</p>

                <p>There have been many attempts to utilize data mining algorithms and tools in advertising, financial services, medical applications and others, but rigorous discussion of Big Data techniques in politics have tended to be closely guarded. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers from interdisciplinary areas and strengthens collaboration between the political science and data mining communities in understanding the contemporary use of Big Data techniques in political campaigning. We encourage a useful exchange of ideas, techniques and datasets between researchers, political practitioners, social entrepreneurs, and corporate representatives through the workshop. Possible topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Political dataset collection, dimensionality reduction, cleaning, and processing</li>
                <li>Applications of Big Data analytics to election campaigns</li>
                <li>Sentiment analysis to predict political opinions</li>
                <li>Social network analysis as a tool for political influence and prediction</li>
                <li>Data-oriented innovations in politics</li>
                <li>Case studies of data mining tools for politics</li>
